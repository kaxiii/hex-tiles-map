# Hexagonal Grid Map

## Overview

This project features an interactive hexagonal grid map built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). The map allows users to navigate through a large grid of hexagons, each displaying its unique coordinates. Users can select individual hexagons by clicking on them, and only one hexagon can be selected at a time. The map also supports mouse dragging and keyboard navigation (WASD keys) for seamless movement, along with zoom functionality.

## Features

- **Hexagonal Grid Layout**: Dynamic generation of hexagonal cells that fill a specified area.
- **Hexagon Selection**: Click to select a hexagon. Clicking again on the selected hexagon will deselect it.
- **Mouse Dragging**: Click and drag to move the map around.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move the map in all directions.
- **Zoom Functionality**: Scroll with the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the map.
- **Non-selectable Text**: Hexagon numbers cannot be selected, enhancing user experience.
